# blood-donation

## Aim
- This is a project aiming to automate the process of blood donation entries.

## General Info
- It is a responsive website. You can visit it [here](https://blood-donation45.herokuapp.com/).
- List of donors is displayed in table. The name is a hyperlink to the profile of that donor. Delete button will remove donor from database. Rest all is just plain information about donor.
- Navbar contains 2 links one to donors list and another to add a new donor and save it in database.
- Add new donor links takes you to a page where a form is presented when you visit the website which takes input for data of the new donor.
- Profile page has all the details you entered when adding new donor. It shows 2 latest blood donation dates and a has a link to add a recent donation data and amount with your present weight. All the data presented in the profile page is editable.
